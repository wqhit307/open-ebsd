# Install Required Packages #

## Compiler ##
Microsoft Visual C++ Express can be used to compile OpenEBSD. It is available as a free download from http://www.microsoft.com/express/download/

## SVN Client ##
A SVN client is required to download the source. TortoiseSVN is a good free client for windows, available from http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads

## CMake ##
Build files for the project are generated by CMake, builiding VTK also requires CMake. A Windows installer is available at http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

## VTK ##
The Visualisation Toolkit is used for visualisation. Since we need the header files to link from C++, it must be compiled from source. The source and instructions for compiling are availible at http://www.vtk.org/. When compiling the _Build Shared Libraries_  options should be selected to ensure that the python interfaces are built.

## wxWidgets ##
wxWidgets is required for the user interface. A windows installer is available from http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/ (choose wxMSW). After installation you must build wxWidgets:

  1. Navigate to C:\wxWidgets-2.8.10\build\msw (or wherever you installed wxWidgets). Open wx.dsw which will open Visual C++
  1. In Solution Explorer, open core>Setup>setup.h (there are two setup.h files; choose the one with 'wx/msw/setup.h' in the first line)
  1. Search for 'wxUSE\_GLCANVAS', and change '#DEFINE wxUSE\_GLCANVAS 0' to '#DEFINE wxUSE\_GLCANVAS 0'
  1. Under Build>Configuration Manager, select 'Debug'
  1. Select Build>Build Solution
  1. Under Build>Configuration Manager, select 'Release'
  1. Select Build>Build Solution

Do not build any other of the configurations, as they can interfere with one another.
